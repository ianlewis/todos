`todos` is a fast [unixy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) CLI
tool that searches for TODO comments in code and prints them in various
formats.

## üöÄ Installation

`todos` can be installed via multiple methods.

### Install pre-built binaries

Download the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier)
and verify it's checksum:

```shell
curl -sSLo slsa-verifier https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/releases/download/v2.6.0/slsa-verifier-linux-amd64 && \
echo "1c9c0d6a272063f3def6d233fa3372adbaff1f5a3480611a07c744e73246b62d  slsa-verifier" | sha256sum -c - && \
chmod +x slsa-verifier
```

Download and verify the `todos` binary and verify it's provenance:

```shell
curl -sSLo todos https://github.com/ianlewis/todos/releases/download/v0.13.0/todos-linux-amd64 && \
curl -sSLo todos.intoto.jsonl https://github.com/ianlewis/todos/releases/download/v0.13.0/todos-linux-amd64.intoto.jsonl && \
./slsa-verifier verify-artifact todos --provenance-path todos.intoto.jsonl --source-uri github.com/ianlewis/todos --source-tag v0.13.0 && \
chmod +x todos && \
cp todos ~/bin/
```

### Install using `npm`

Install `todos` by installing the `@ianlewis/todos` package from `npm`:

```shell
npm install -g @ianlewis/todos
```

Verify the package signature:

```shell
npm audit signatures
```

### Docker image

Download and run `todos` with Docker. You should use a specific version tag:

```shell
docker run --rm -t -v $(pwd):/src ghcr.io/ianlewis/todos:v0.13.0 /src
```

Verify the image attestation using
[`cosign`](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/verifying/attestation/):

```shell
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type slsaprovenance \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_container_slsa3.yml@refs/tags/v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+$' \
  --certificate-github-workflow-repository "ianlewis/todos" \
  --certificate-github-workflow-ref "refs/tags/v0.13.0" \
  ghcr.io/ianlewis/todos:v0.13.0
```

### Install from source

If you already have Go 1.20+ you can install the latest version using `go install`:

```shell
go install github.com/ianlewis/todos/cmd/todos
```

#### Install as a Go tool dependency

You can also install `todos` from source as a [Go tool dependency](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#tools).

```shell
go get -tool github.com/ianlewis/todos/cmd/todos
```

This will allow you to use `todos` in your project using the `go tool` command.

```shell
go tool github.com/ianlewis/todos/cmd/todos
```

Be aware though that there are a few downsides to using the Go tools approach.

- This will compile `todos` locally and using your local Go version.
- The dependencies used to compile `todos` may be different than those used to
  compile its releases and thus is not guaranteed to work.
- It allows installation from the main branch, which may not be stable.
- It's slower than binary installation.

## üìñ Usage

Simply running `todos` will search TODO comments starting in the current
directory. By default it ignores files that are in "VCS" directories (such as`.git`
or `.hg`) and vendored code (such as `node_modules`, `vendor`, and `third_party`).

Here is an example running in a checkout of the
[`Kubernetes`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) codebase.

```shell
kubernetes$ todos
build/common.sh:346:# TODO: remove when 17.06.0 is not relevant anymore
build/lib/release.sh:148:# TODO: Docker images here
cluster/addons/addon-manager/kube-addons.sh:233:# TODO: Remove the first command in future release.
cluster/addons/calico-policy-controller/ipamblock-crd.yaml:41:# TODO: This nullable is manually added in. We should update controller-gen
cluster/addons/dns/kube-dns/kube-dns.yaml.base:119:# TODO: Set memory limits when we've profiled the container for large
...
```

### Supported Languages

`todos` supports a wide variety of languages and file formats. It detects the
language of a file based on its extension, shebang line, or the contents of the
file.

See [`SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.md`] for a full list of supported languages and
comment types.

### TODO format

"TODO" comments are comments in code that mark a task that is intended to be
done in the future.

For example:

```go
// TODO(label): message text
```

#### TODO type variants

There a few variants of this type of comment that are in wide use.

- **`TODO`**: A general TODO comment indicating something that is to be done in
  the future.
- **`FIXME`**: Something that is broken that needs to be fixed in the code.
- **`BUG`**: A bug in the code that needs to be fixed.
- **`HACK`**: This code is a "hack"; a hard to understand or brittle piece of
  code. It could use a cleanup.
- **`XXX`**: Danger! Similar to "HACK". Modifying this code is dangerous. It
- **`COMBAK`**: Something you should "come back" to.

#### TODO examples

TODO comments can include some optional metadata. Here are some examples:

- A naked TODO comment.

    ```go
    // TODO
    ```

- A TODO comment with an explanation message

    ```go
    // TODO: Do something.
    ```

- A TODO comment with a linked bug or issue and optional message

    ```go
    // TODO(github.com/ianlewis/todos/issues/8): Do something.
    ```

- A TODO comment with a username and optional message. This type is discouraged
  as it links the issue to a specific developer but can be helpful temporarily
  when making changes to a PR. Linking to issues is recommended for permanent
  comments.

    ```go
    // TODO(ianlewis): Do something.
    ```

### Use Cases

Tracking TODOs in code can help you have a cleaner and healthier code base. Here
are some basic use cases.

#### Finding TODOs in your code

You can use the `todos` to find TODO comments in your code and print them out.
Running it will search the directory tree starting at the current directory by
default.

```shell
$ todos
main.go:27:// TODO(#123): Return a proper exit code.
main.go:28:// TODO(ianlewis): Implement the main method.
```

In order for the comments to be more easily parsed keep in mind the following:

- Spaces between the comment start and 'TODO' is optional (e.g. `//TODO: some comment`)
- TODOs should have a colon if a message is present so it can be distinguished
  from normal comments.
- TODOs can be prefixed with `@` (e.g. `// @TODO: comment`)
- Comments can be on the same line with other code (e.g. `x = f() // TODO: call f`
- Line comment start sequences can be repeated (e.g. `//// TODO: some comment`)
- Only the single line where the TODO occurs is printed for multi-line comments.
- `TODO`,`FIXME`,`BUG`,`HACK`,`XXX`,`COMBAK` are supported by default. You can
  change this with the `--todo-types` flag.

#### Running on sub-directories or files

You can run `todos` on sub-directories or individual files by passing them on
the command line.

```shell
kubernetes$ todos hack/ Makefile
hack/e2e-internal/e2e-cluster-size.sh:32:#TODO(colhom): spec and implement federated version of this
hack/ginkgo-e2e.sh:118:# TODO(kubernetes/test-infra#3330): Allow NODE_INSTANCE_GROUP to be
hack/lib/golang.sh:456:# TODO: This symlink should be relative.
hack/lib/protoc.sh:119:# TODO: switch to universal binary when updating to 3.20+
hack/lib/util.sh:337:# TODO(lavalamp): Simplify this by moving pkg/api/v1 and splitting pkg/api,
...
```

#### Outputting JSON

`todos` can produce output in JSON format for more complicated processing.

```shell
kubernetes$ todos -o json
{"path":"build/common.sh","type":"TODO","text":"# TODO: remove when 17.06.0 is not relevant anymore","label":"","message":"remove when 17.06.0 is not relevant anymore","line":346,"comment_line":346}
{"path":"build/lib/release.sh","type":"TODO","text":"# TODO: Docker images here","label":"","message":"Docker images here","line":148,"comment_line":148}
{"path":"cluster/addons/addon-manager/kube-addons.sh","type":"TODO","text":"# TODO: Remove the first command in future release.","label":"","message":"Remove the first command in future release.","line":233,"comment_line":233}
{"path":"cluster/addons/calico-policy-controller/ipamblock-crd.yaml","type":"TODO","text":"# TODO: This nullable is manually added in. We should update controller-gen","label":"","message":"This nullable is manually added in. We should update controller-gen","line":41,"comment_line":41}
{"path":"cluster/addons/dns/kube-dns/kube-dns.yaml.base","type":"TODO","text":"# TODO: Set memory limits when we've profiled the container for large","label":"","message":"Set memory limits when we've profiled the container for large","line":119,"comment_line":119}
...
```

```shell
kubernetes$ # Get all the unique files with TODOs that Tim Hockin owns.
kubernetes$ todos -o json | jq -r '. | select(.label = "thockin") | .path' | uniq
```

### Running on GitHub Actions

If run as part of a GitHub action `todos` will function much like a linter and
output GitHub workflow commands which will add check comments to PRs.

```shell
kubernetes$ todos -o github Makefile
::warning file=Makefile,line=313::# TODO(thockin): Remove this in v1.29.
::warning file=Makefile,line=504::#TODO: make EXCLUDE_TARGET auto-generated when there are other files in cmd/
```

An example workflow might look like the following. `todos` will output GitHub
Actions workflow commands by default when running on GitHub Actions:

```yaml
on:
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]
    workflow_dispatch:

permissions: {}

jobs:
    todos:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            contents: read
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/actions/installer@v2.7.0
            - name: install todos
              run: |
                  set -euo pipefail

                  curl -sSLo todos \
                    https://github.com/ianlewis/todos/releases/download/v0.13.0/todos-linux-amd64 && \
                  curl -sSLo todos.intoto.jsonl \
                    https://github.com/ianlewis/todos/releases/download/v0.13.0/todos-linux-amd64.intoto.jsonl && \
                  slsa-verifier verify-artifact todos \
                    --provenance-path todos.intoto.jsonl \
                    --source-uri github.com/ianlewis/todos \
                    --source-tag v0.13.0 && \
                  rm -f slsa-verifier && \
                  chmod +x todos

            - name: run todos
              run: |
                  ./todos .
```

#### Finding authors of TODOs (EXPERIMENTAL)

You can use the `--blame` flag to find the author of a TODO comment. This will
use `git blame` to find the latest author of the line where the TODO comment
occurs. However, this can be slow for large repositories
([#1519](https://github.com/ianlewis/todos/issues/1519)).

```shell
$ todos --blame
.github/workflows/schedule.scorecard.yml:80:Ian Lewis <ian@ianlewis.org>:# TODO: Remove the next line for private repositories with GitHub Advanced Security.
.golangci.yml:172:Ian Lewis <ian@ianlewis.org>:# TODO(#1725): Reduce package average complexity.
Makefile:525:Ian Lewis <ian@ianlewis.org>:# TODO: remove when todos v0.13.0 is released. \
cmd/todos/app.go:42:Ian Lewis <ianlewis@google.com>:// TODO(github.com/urfave/cli/issues/1809): Remove init func when upstream bug is fixed.
internal/scanner/languages.go:37:Ian Lewis <ian@ianlewis.org>:// TODO(#1686): Refactor language config global variables.
internal/scanner/languages.go:143:Ian Lewis <ian@ianlewis.org>:// TODO(#1686): Refactor LanguagesConfig global variable.
...
```

#### Documenting tasks

You can use the output of `todos` to create documentation of tasks.

For example, this creates a simple markdown document:

```shell
$ (
    echo "# TODOs" && \
    echo && \
    todos --exclude-dir .venv --output json | \
        jq -r 'if (.label | startswith("#")) then "- [ ] \(.label) \(.message)" else empty end' | \
        uniq
) > todos.md

$ cat todos.md
# TODOs

- [ ] #1546 Support @moduledoc
- [ ] #96 Use a *Config
- [ ] #96 Use []*Comment and go-cmp
- [ ] #1627 Support OCaml nested comments.
- [ ] #1540 Read this closed string as a comment.
- [ ] #1545 Generate Go code rather than loading YAML at runtime.
```

#### Re-open prematurely closed GitHub issues

Sometimes issues get closed before all of the relevant code is updated. You can
use `todos` to re-open issues where TODO comments that reference the issue
still exist in the code.

```golang
// TODO(#123): Still needs work.
```

## üìö FAQ

### Why use this?

Tracking TODOs in code can help you have a cleaner and healthier code base.

1. It can help you realize when issues you thought were complete actually
   require some additional work (See [`ianlewis/todo-issue-reopener`]).
2. It makes it easier for contributors to find areas of the code that need work.
3. It makes it easier for contributors to find the relevant code for an issue.

### Why not just use `grep` or `rg`?

`grep` and `rg` are amazing and very fast tools. However, there are a few
reasons why you might use `todos`.

1. `grep` and `rg` don't have much knowledge of code and languages so it's
   difficult to differentiate between comments and code. `todos` will ignore
   matches in code and only prints TODOs found it comments. It also ignores
   matches that occur in strings.
2. `grep` doesn't know about repository structure. It doesn't have inherent
   knowledge of VCS directories (e.g. `.git`) or vendored dependencies. It can't
   make use of `.gitignore` or other hints.
3. `todos` can output JSON with parsed values from the TODOs. This gives users
   an easy way to search for TODOs with their username, or with a specific issue
   number.
